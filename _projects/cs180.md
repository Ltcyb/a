The link here will bring you the the projects I've done for UC Berkeley [CS 180](https://cal-cs180.github.io/fa24/) Computer Vision course. My personal favorites are the [diffusion models project](https://ltcyb.github.io/cs180-portfolio/proj5/) and the [implementation of NeRF](https://ltcyb.github.io/cs180-portfolio/proj6/).
